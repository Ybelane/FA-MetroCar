# FA-MetroCar
The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the customer funnel for Metrocar, aimed to enhance the efficiency and user experience of the ride-sharing app a like Uber/Lyft. The primary goal was to identify areas for improvement and optimization within the customer journey by addressing key business questions, the analysis focused on two critical funnel stages: user activation from signup to ride request and ride delivery from request to acceptance. The analysis aimed to answer specific business questions posed by stakeholders, focusing on key drop-off points in the funnel and the findings informed strategic recommendations to improve these areas, ultimately optimizing the customer journey. Additionally, insights were provided to address platform-specific marketing strategies, age group performance, ride request distribution, and the identification of the lowest-converting funnel stage.
